2. REPORT DETAILS

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.753 ns between digit_decoder/input_digit_int_reg[2]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and digit_decoder/th_part_reg[3]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.809 ns between digit_decoder/input_digit_int_reg[2]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and digit_decoder/th_part_reg[1]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
